# Embersim
*Aerodynamics Simulation for Vehicle ascent and descent through the Atmosphere.*

*Compatible with Windows and Linux.*

# How to use:

Currently what you can do is put a flight profile consisting of altitude and speed in two columns as a .csv file into the data folder included with this project and calculate aerodynamical data for the flight. The data will be put into the aerodynamics.csv file.

# Example:

The example file included is asc_pattern.csv and goes from 1 meter to 100 km and 1 m/s to 100 km/s. You can run this file or modify it to test the program.
