# Embersim
*Aerodynamics Simulation for Vehicle ascent and descent through the Atmosphere.*

*Compatible with Windows and Linux.*

# How to use:

Currently what you can do is put a flight profile consisting of altitude and speed in two columns as a .csv file into the data folder included with this project and calculate aerodynamical data for the flight. The data will be put into the cal_result.csv file.

**Warning** currently results will always overwrite the file so save any data you need before running the program again.

# Example:

The example files included are test02.csv and asc_pattern.csv of which the later is just a big testing file and the former is a more realistic profile. You can run this file or modify it to test the program.
